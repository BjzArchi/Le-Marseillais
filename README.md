# Le Marseillais - Sea Food Restaurant ðŸŒŠ


Le Marseillais is a responsive restaurant website that showcases Mediterranean cuisine. From designing mockups to coding, I've put a lot of effort into creating a beautiful and user-friendly website that will help customers get a sense of what they can expect when they visit it.
